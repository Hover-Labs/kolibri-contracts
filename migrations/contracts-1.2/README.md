# Contracts 1.2

These contracts implement the KSR. 

## Playbooks
### Sandboxnet

**Ensure up to date and clean checkout**
```
$ git pull
$ git status
```

**Ensure correct SmartPy Version**

```
sh <(curl -s https://smartpy.io/releases/20210708-4662b0f8b1fe2186a243078f9f1ba0a4aa1c6f16/cli/install.sh)
```

**Remove any stale data**
```
npm run install-submodules
rm -rf src/config.ts deploy-data.json
```

**Reset Sandbox**

Use the Discord bot!

**Run Migration**

NOTE: The DEPLOY_SK account needs $3 of kUSD on it to complete this migration.

```
export DEPLOY_SK=esdk...
cp src/config.sandbox.ts src/config.ts
ts-node src/flows/migrate.ts
```

**Validate Results**

Validate storage:
```
ts-node src/verifications/verify-storage.ts
```

**Test Break Glass and DAO Integrations**

Note that these interactions will break glass and thus make the contracts inoperable. 

```
ts-node src/verifications/verify-pause-guardian-and-dao-and-break-glass.ts
```

**Generate Governance Lambda**

```
ts-node src/flows/generate-governance-lambda.ts
```

**Post Governance Validation**

Validate that contracts are hooked up and functioning:
1. Do static validation by inspecting contract storage
2. Smoke test that the system still works by creating an oven, depositing collateral, borrowing kUSD, waiting for a few periods for interest to accrue and repaying kUSD
3. Validate that #2 caused interest to accrue to the new stability fund
4. Smoke test that savings pool is working correctly by depositing collateral, borrowing kUSD, depositing kUSD in the savings pool, waiting for a few periods for interest to accrue, withdrawing kUSD and repaying the oven.
5. Validate that #4 caused us to receive more kUSD from the pool than we put in. 

NOTE: The DEPLOY_SK account needs 10 XTZ on it to complete this migration.
NOTE: This validation will leave 10 XTZ in a newly deployed oven.

Note: This test will borrow and repay from an oven generated by DEPLOY_SK. This account needs to be funded.
```
ts-node src/verifications/post-proposal-tests.ts
```

Validate that the multisig can move remaining stability fund value:
```
ts-node src/verifications/verify-stability-fund-msig.ts
```
